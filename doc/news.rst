* **28.11.2014** Version 2014.4 released (preliminary support for 1D problems,
  data probes using pyVTK library, etc.), see :ref:`release notes
  <2014.3-2014.4>`.

* **25.09.2014** Version 2014.3 released (isogeometric analysis (IGA) speed-up
  by C implementation of NURBS basis evaluation, generalized linear combination
  boundary conditions that work between different fields/variables and support
  non-homogeneous periodic conditions, non-constant essential boundary
  conditions given by a function in IGA, reorganized and improved
  documentation, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2014.2-2014.3>`.

* **23.05.2014** Version 2014.2 released (preliminary support for isogeometric
  analysis, improved postprocessing and visualization script for time-dependent
  problems with adaptive time steps, three new terms, etc.), see :ref:`release
  notes <2014.1-2014.2>`.

* **25.02.2014** Version 2014.1 released (sfepy.fem was split to separate
  FEM-specific and general modules, lower memory usage by creating active DOF
  connectivities directly from field connectivities, new handling of field and
  variable shapes, clean up: many obsolete modules were removed, all module
  names follow naming conventions, etc.), see :ref:`release notes
  <2013.4-2014.1>`.

* **22.11.2013** Version 2013.4 released (simplified quadrature definition,
  equation sequence solver, initial support for 'plate'
  integration/connectivity type, script for visualization of quadrature points
  and weights, etc.), see :ref:`release notes <2013.3-2013.4>`.
