Supported Platforms
-------------------

*SfePy* is known to work on various flavors of recent Linux, Intel-based MacOS
and Windows. SfePy requires Python 3. The release 2019.4 was the last with
Python 2.7 support.

Note: Depending on Python installation and OS used, replacing ``python`` by
``python3`` might be required in all the commands below
(e.g. in :ref:`compilation`) in order to use Python 3.


Requirements
------------

Installation prerequisites, required to build *SfePy*:

- a C compiler suite,
- `Python`_ 3.x,
- `NumPy`_,
- `Cython`_.

Python packages required for using *SfePy*:

- `Pyparsing`_,
- `SciPy`_,
- `meshio`_ for reading and writing mesh files,
- `scikit-umfpack`_ for enabling `UMFPACK`_ solver for SciPy >= 0.14.0,
- `Matplotlib`_ for various plots, GTKAgg for live plotting via log.py,
- `PyTables`_ for storing results in HDF5 files,
- `SymPy`_ for some tests and functions,
- `Mayavi`_ for postproc.py,
- `igakit`_ for script/gen_iga_patch.py - simple IGA domain generator,
- `petsc4py`_ and `mpi4py`_ for running parallel examples and using parallel
  solvers from `PETSc`_,
- `slepc4py`_ for eigenvalue problem solvers from `SLEPc`_
- `pymetis`_ for mesh partitioning using `Metis`_,
- `wxPython`_ for better `IPython`_ integration.
- `Read the Docs`_ `Sphinx`_ theme for building documentation
- `psutil`_ for memory requirements checking
- `PyVista`_ for post-processing via `resview.py`

Make sure the dependencies of those packages are also installed (e.g `igakit`_
reguires FORTRAN compiler, `scikit-umfpack`_ does not work without UMFPACK,
`petsc4py`_ without PETSc etc.). All dependencies of `meshio`_ need to be
installed for full mesh file format support (when using pip: ``pip install
meshio[all]``).

*SfePy* should work both with bleeding edge (Git) and last released versions of
`NumPy` and `SciPy`. Please, submit an issue at `Issues`_ page in case this
does not hold.

Other dependencies/suggestions:

- To be able to (re)generate the documentation `Sphinx`_, `numpydoc`_ and
  `LaTeX`_ are needed (see :ref:`how_to_regenerate_documentation`).
- If `doxygen` is installed, the documentation of data structures and functions
  can be automatically generated by running::

   python setup.py doxygendocs

- Mesh generation tools use `pexpect` and `gmsh` or `tetgen`.
- `IPython`_ is recommended over the regular Python shell to fluently follow
  some parts of primer/tutorial (see :ref:`using-ipython`).
- `MUMPS`_ library for using MUMPS linear direct solver
  (real and complex arithmetic, parallel factorization)

.. _Python_distribution:

Notes on selecting Python Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*SfePy* should work with any recent Python 3.x (in long-term view
Python 3.6+ is recommended). It is only matter of taste to use either native OS
Python installation or any other suitable distribution. We could recommend
the following distributions to use:

- **Linux**: OS native installation (See `Notes on Installing SfePy
  Dependencies on Various Platforms`_ for further details.)

- **macOS**: multi-platform scientific Python distributions `Anaconda`_ (See
  `Notes on Multi-platform Python Distributions`_ for further details.)

- **Windows**: use free versions of commercial multi-platform
  scientific Python distributions `Anaconda`_ or
  `Enthought Canopy`_ (see `Notes on Multi-platform Python Distributions`_ for
  further details). In addition a completely free open-source portable
  distribution `WinPython`_ can be used.

On any supported platform we could recommend `Anaconda`_ distribution as
easy-to-use, stable and up-to-date Python distribution with all the
required dependencies (including pre-built `sfepy` package).

Note: all *SfePy* releases are regularly tested on recent Linux distributions
(Debian and (K)Ubuntu) using OS Python installation and Anaconda, macOS 10.12+
using Anaconda and Windows 8.1+ using Anaconda.

.. _installing_sfepy:

Installing SfePy
----------------

For `Anaconda`_ and `.deb` based Linux distributions (Debian, (K)Ubuntu),
pre-built *SfePy* packages are available. You may directly install them with:

- `Anaconda`_ distribution: install `sfepy` from `conda-forge`_ channel::

   conda install -c conda-forge sfepy

- Debian/(K)Ubuntu: install `python-sfepy`::

   sudo apt-get install python-sfepy

There are no further steps required to install/configure *SfePy*
(see `Notes on Multi-platform Python Distributions`_ for additional notes).


.. _running_sfepy_docker_images:

Using SfePy Docker Images
---------------------------

Besides the classical installation we also provide experimental Docker images
with ready-to-run Anaconda and *Sfepy* installation.

Before you start using *SfePy* images, you need to first install and configure
Docker on your computer. To do this follow official
`Docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`__.

Currently available images are:

- `sfepy/sfepy-notebook <https://hub.docker.com/r/sfepy/sfepy-notebook>`__ -
  basic command line interface and web browser access to
  Jupyter notebook/JupyterLab interface,

- `sfepy/sfepy-x11vnc-desktop
  <https://hub.docker.com/r/sfepy/sfepy-x11vnc-desktop>`__ -
  optimized Ubuntu desktop environment accessible via standard web browser
  or VNC client.

For available runtime options and further information see
`sfepy-docker <https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy-docker>`__ project on Github.


.. _installing_from_sources:

Installing SfePy from Sources
-----------------------------

The latest stable release can be obtained from the `download`_ page. Otherwise,
download the development version of the code from `SfePy git repository`_::

    git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

In case you wish to use a specific release instead of the latest master
version, use::

    git tag -l

to see the available releases - the release tags have form
`release_<year>.<int>`.

See the `download`_ page for additional download options.

.. _compilation:

Compilation of C Extension Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the *SfePy* top-level directory:

#. Look at ``site_cfg_template.py`` and follow the instructions
   therein. Usually no changes are necessary.

#. Compile the extension modules

   - for in-place use::

        python setup.py build_ext --inplace

   - for installation::

        python setup.py build

  We recommend starting with the in-place build.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*SfePy* can be used without any installation by running its main scripts
and examples from the top-level directory of the distribution or can be
installed *locally* or *system-wide*:

- system-wide (may require root privileges)::

    python setup.py install

- local (requires write access to ``<installation prefix>``)::

    python setup.py install --root=<installation prefix>

If all went well, proceed with `Testing Installation`_.

.. _testing_installation:

Testing Installation
--------------------

After building and/or installing *SfePy* you should check if all the
functions are working properly by running the automated tests.

Running Automated Test Suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on type of your build run following tests:

- in-place build::

    python ./run_tests.py

  or ::

    python ./sfepy-run run_tests

  or (on Unix-based systems) directly by ::

    ./sfepy-run run_tests


- installed (local or system-wide) build::

    sfepy-run run_tests

  (This command creates a directory called ``'output'`` in the current
  directory as well as some other auxiliary files. Use the in-place build
  testing if you do not want to care about this.)

  Please note this method is *not fully supported on Windows
  systems yet*. It can be currently used only with pre-compiled `sfepy`
  packages (see `Installing SfePy`_).


Running Failing Tests in Raise Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a particular test fails, run it in the raise mode ::

    python sfepy-run run_tests --raise tests/<failing_test_name.py>

and, please, report the output to the `SfePy mailing list`_.

It is also possible to automatically start a debugger when/if an exception
is raised by running a test in the debug mode::

    python sfepy-run run_tests --debug tests/failing_test_name.py



Debugging
---------

If something goes wrong,  edit the ``site_cfg.py`` config file and set
``debug_flags = '-DDEBUG_FMF'``
to turn on bound checks in the low level C functions, and recompile the code::

    python setup.py clean
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Then re-run your code and report the output to the `SfePy mailing list`_.

.. _using-ipython:

Using IPython
-------------

We generally recommend to use (a customized) `IPython`_ interactive shell over
the regular Python interpreter when following :doc:`tutorial` or
:doc:`primer` (or even for any regular interactive work with *SfePy*).

Install `IPython`_ (as a generic part of your selected distribution) and then
customize it to your choice.

Depending on your IPython usage, you can customize your `default` profile or
create a *SfePy* specific new one as follows:

#. Create a new *SfePy* profile::

     ipython profile create sfepy

#. Open the ``~/.ipython/profile_sfepy/ipython_config.py`` file in a text
   editor and add/edit after the ``c = get_config()`` line:

   .. sourcecode:: python

      exec_lines = [
          'import numpy as nm',
          'import matplotlib as mpl',
          'mpl.use("WXAgg")',
      #
      # Add your preferred SfePy customization here...
      #
      ]

      c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = exec_lines
      c.TerminalIPythonApp.gui = 'wx'
      c.TerminalInteractiveShell.colors = 'Linux' # NoColor, Linux, or LightBG

   Please note, that generally it is not recommended to use `star` (*)
   imports here.

#. Run the customized IPython shell::

     ipython --profile=sfepy


.. _multi_platform_distributions_notes:

Notes on Multi-platform Python Distributions
--------------------------------------------

Anaconda
^^^^^^^^

We highly recommend this scientific-oriented Python distribution.

(Currently regularly tested by developers on *SfePy* releases
with Python 3.6 64-bit on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Windows 8.1+ and macOS 10.12+.)

Download appropriate `Anaconda`_ Python 3.x installer package and follow
install instructions. We recommend to choose *user-level* install option (no
admin privileges required).

Anaconda can be used for:

#. installing the latest release of *SfePy*  directly from the `conda-forge`_
   channel (see `sfepy-feedstock`_). In this case, follow the instructions
   in `Installing SfePy`_.

   Installing/upgrading *SfePy*  from the conda-forge channel can also be
   achieved by adding `conda-forge`_ to your channels with::

     conda config --add channels conda-forge

   Once the `conda-forge`_ channel has been enabled, *SfePy* can be installed
   with::

     conda install sfepy

   It is possible to list all of the versions of *SfePy*  available on your
   platform with::

     conda search sfepy --channel conda-forge

#. installing the *SfePy* dependencies only - then proceed with the
   :ref:`installing_from_sources` instructions.

   In this case, install the missing/required packages using built-in `conda`
   package manager::

     conda install mayavi wxpython

   See `conda help` for further information.

Occasionally, you should check for distribution and/or installed packages
updates (there is no built-in automatic update mechanism available)::

  conda update conda
  conda update anaconda
  conda update <package>

or try::

  conda update --all


Compilation of C Extension Modules on Windows
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To build *SfePy* extension modules, included `mingw-w32/64`_ compiler tools
should work fine. If you encounter any problems, we recommend to install and
use Microsoft `Visual C++ Build Tools`_ instead (see `Anaconda FAQ`_).
