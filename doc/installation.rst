Requirements
------------

Installation prerequisites:

* recent numpy, scipy (with umfpack wrapper, or umfpack scikit), cython

Dependencies:

* matplotlib, pyparsing, umfpack, pytables
* some tests and functions use sympy
* schroedinger.py requires pysparse, pexpect, gmsh (2D), tetgen (3D)
* log.py (live plotting) requires multiprocessing, matplotlib with GTKAgg
* isfepy requires ipython, matplotlib with WXAgg
* postproc.py requires mayavi2
* to be able to (re)generate the documentation: sphinx, numpydoc, LaTeX, see
  :ref:`how_to_regenerate_documentation`

*SfePy* is known to work on various flavours of Linux, on Intel Macs and
Windows.

On Linux, consult the package manager of your favourite distribution,
see `Platform-specific notes`_.

On Windows, all the required packages are part of the `Enthought Python
Distribution`_ (EPD), which is free for academic purposes. A completely free
`Python(x,y)`_ can be used too, but pyparsing has to be installed
manually. Instructions for installing Python(x,y) can be found in `Windows
using Python(x,y)`_.

*SfePy* can be used without any installation by running the scripts from
the top-level directory of the distribution (TOPDIR), or can be
installed locally or system-wide.

*SfePy* should work both with bleeding edge (Git) and last released versions of
NumPy and SciPy. Submit an issue at `Issues`_ page in case this does not hold.

Generic Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

Download the latest source release or the development version from `SfePy git
repository`_::

    git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

See the `download`_ page for additional download options.

In-place compilation of C extension modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Look at site_cfg_template.py and follow the instructions
   therein. Usually no changes are necessary.

2. Run::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

(As mentioned above, this step is not required to use *SfePy*.)

* System-Wide (may require root privileges)::

    python setup.py install

* Local (requires write access to ``<installation prefix>``)::

    python setup.py install --root=<installation prefix>

See also INSTALL and RELEASE_NOTES files in the tarball.

If all went well, proceed with `Checking the SfePy installation`_.

Checking the SfePy installation
-------------------------------

After installing *SfePy* you can check if all the functionalities are
working by running the automated tests. From the source directory type::

    ./runTests.py

If a particular test fails, please run it in debug mode::

    ./runTests.py --debug tests/failing_test_name.py

and report the output to the sfepy-devel mailing list.

Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

Gentoo
^^^^^^

::

    emerge -va pytables pyparsing numpy scipy matplotlib ipython mayavi

Archlinux
^^^^^^^^^

::

    pacman -S python2-numpy python2-scipy python2-matplotlib ipython2 python2-sympy
    yaourt -S python-pytables python2-mayavi

Instructions
""""""""""""

Edit Makefile and change all references from python to python2.
Edit scripts and change shebangs to point to python2.

Debian
^^^^^^

   (old instructions, check also Ubuntu below)

::

    apt-get install python-tables python-pyparsing python-matplotlib python-scipy

Ubuntu
^^^^^^

(tested on Ubuntu 11.10)

Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

First, you have to install the dependencies packages::

    sudo aptitude install python-scipy python-matplotlib python-tables python-pyparsing libsuitesparse-dev python-setuptools mayavi2 python-dev ipython python-sympy cython python-sparse

The same packages work also in Kubuntu 11.10. If `aptitude` is not
installed, install it, or try `apt-get` instead.

Older Versions of Ubuntu
''''''''''''''''''''''''

(tested on Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 and Lucid Lynx 10.04)

The following is required to get working umfpack.  Download and install
the umfpack scikits in some local dir. In the following example it will
be installed in $HOME/local::

    svn checkout http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/trunk/umfpack
    cd umfpack
    mkdir -p ${HOME}/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages
    python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/local

Add to your .bashrc the line::

    export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/local"

then re-open a terminal and if the scikits was installed correctly importing
scikits.umfpack in python should give no error::

    python
    >>> import scikits.umfpack
    >>>

Next Download sympy 6.7 or later. Extract the contents.

cd sympy-0.6.7

python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/local

Installing SfePy
""""""""""""""""

Now download the latest *SfePy* tarball release (or the latest development
version).

Uncompress the archive and enter the *SfePy* dir, then type::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

after a few minutes the compilation finishes.

Finally you can test *SfePy* with::

    ./runTests.py

If some test fails see `Checking the SfePy installation`_ section for further
details.


Fedora 8
^^^^^^^^
Notes on using umfpack (contributed by David Huard).

entry in numpy site.cfg::

    [umfpack]
    library_dirs=/usr/lib64
    include_dirs = /usr/include/suitesparse

Comment by david.huard, Mar 26, 2008::

  Of course, suitesparse and suitesparse-devel must be installed.

Intel Mac
^^^^^^^^^

(thanks to Dominique Orban for his advice)

To build *SfePy* on an Intel Mac the following options need to be set in
site_cfg.py::

    opt_flags = '-g -O2 -fPIC -DPIC -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic'
    link_flags = '-dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup -fPIC -DPIC'

Windows using Python(x,y)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(tested on Windows 7)

Here we provide instructions for using *SfePy* on Windows through
`Python(x,y)`_. We will also use `msysgit`_ to install the umfpack scikit to
speed performance.

This procedure was tested on a Windows 7 machine. It should work in
theory for any Windows machine supported by Python(x,y) and msysgit, but your
milage may vary.

There several steps, but hopefully it is straightforward to follow this
procedure. If you have any questions or difficulties please feel free to ask on
the sfepy-devel mailing list (see `SfePy web site`_). Also, if you have any
suggestions for improving or streamlining this process, it would be very
beneficial as well!

We assume the installation to be done in C:/ - substitute your path
where appropriate.

Steps to get a working *SfePy* on Windows using Python(x,y)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. Minimum 4 Gigabytes of free disk space is required, Due to the
   installed size of python(x,y) and msysgit.

#. Download the latest `Python(x,y)`_ windows installer (version 2.7.X.X), and
   make a *Full installation* in the default installation directory.

#. Download the latest `pyparsing`_ windows installer (Python version 2.7) and
   install it in the default installation directory.

#. Download the latest `msysgit`_ windows installer and install it in the
   default installation directory:

   -  either get the file that begins with "Git-", which gives you
      gitbash - a bash shell in Windows,

   - or get the file that begins with "msysGit-fullinstall".

   Below we refer to either gitbash or msys as "shell".

#. Download the latest `umfpackpy`_ zip archive and follow the instructions
   below:

   a) Extract the *umfpackpy_<version>.zip* to your convenient location in
      Hard disk, Lets assume it's extracted in C:/. Now there will be
      two files on the extracted folder, *ez_setup.py* and
      *scikits.umfpack-5.1.0-py2.7-win32.egg*.

   b) Start a shell (gitbash or msys, depending on the previous step)
      and write the following to go to the extracted folder::

          cd /c/umfpackpy_<version>/

   c) Install the UMFPACK library for python::

          ez_setup.py scikits.umfpack-5.1.0-py2.7-win32.egg

#. Download the `cython`_ zip archive, extract it and install::

          cd cython_<version>/
          python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

#. Either `download`_ the latest sfepy tarball and extract it to your
   convenient location in Hard disk, Lets assume it's extracted in C:/.

   Or, If you want to use the latest features and contribute to the
   development of *SfePy*, clone the git development repository

      * In shell, type::

          cd /c/
          git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

   Then follow the instructions below:

   a) In shell, go to the extracted folder::

          cd /c/sfepy_folder_name/

   b) Compile SfePy C extensions::

          python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=mingw32

#. You should now have a working copy of SfePy on Windows, Please help
   aid SfePy development by running the built-in tests. Run the
   *runTests.py* in python IDLE or Write the following code in the
   shell::

       ./runTests.py --filter-less

   * Report any failures to the sfepy-devel mailing list
   * See `Checking the SfePy installation`_ for further details.
