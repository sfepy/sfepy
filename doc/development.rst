Development
===========

If you are interested in working with us, let us know using `our mailing
list`_! Then we recommend reading the :ref:`how_to_contribute` section of our
:ref:`developer_guide`.

We are interested in any contribution. There are many ways how you can
contribute, not just code:

- You can report bugs using `our mailing list`_. You can also add a bug
  report (or a comment) into the `issues`_.
- You can contribute interesting examples/tutorials.
- You can blog about how you use SfePy (let us know!).
- You can help with improving our documentation and these pages.
- ...

To get acquainted with SfePy, you can start by reading the :ref:`sec-tutorial`
and :ref:`sec-primer` sections of the documentation and trying out the examples
that come with the sources. Your first contribution could be pinpointing
anything that is not clear in the docs.
