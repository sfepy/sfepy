Developer Guide
===============

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:
   :backlinks: top

This section purports to document the *SfePy* internals. It is mainly useful
for those who wish to contribute to the development of  *SfePy* and understand
the inner workings of the code.

We use `git`_ to track source code, documentation, examples, and other files
related to the project.

It is not necessary to learn git in order to contribute to *SfePy* but we
strongly suggest you do so as soon as possible - it is an extremely useful tool
not just for writing code, but also for tracking revisions of articles,
Ph.D. theses, books, ... it will also look well in your CV :-) It is also much
easier for us to integrate changes that are in form of a github pull request
than in another form.

Retrieving the Latest Code
--------------------------

The first step is to obtain the latest development version of the code from the
`SfePy git repository`_::

  git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

For development, it is preferable to build the extension modules in place (see
:ref:`compilation`)::

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

On Unix-like systems, you can simply type ``make`` in the top-level folder to
build in-place.

After the initial compilation, or after making changes, do not forget to run
the tests, see :ref:`testing`.

SfePy Directory Structure
-------------------------

Here we list and describe the directories that are in the main sfepy
directory.

.. list-table:: Top directory structure.
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - name
     - description
   * - `build/`
     - directory created by the build process (generated)
   * - `doc/`
     - source files of this documentation
   * - `examples/`
     - example problem description files
   * - `meshes/`
     - finite element mesh files in various formats shared by the examples
   * - `output/`
     - default output directory for storing results of the examples
   * - `output-tests/`
     - output directory for tests
   * - `script/`
     - various small scripts (simple mesh generators, mesh format
       convertors etc.)
   * - `sfepy/`
     - the source code
   * - `tests/`
     - the tests run by `run_tests.py`
   * - `tmp/`
     - directory for temporary files (generated)

New users/developers (after going through the :ref:`sec-tutorial`)
should explore the `examples/` directory. For developers, the principal
directory is `sfepy/`, which has the following contents:

.. list-table:: `sfepy/` directory structure.
   :widths: 10 80 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - name
     - description
     - field-specific
   * - `applications/`
     - top level application classes (e.g. :class:`PDESolverApp` that
       implements all that `simple.py` script does)
     -
   * - `base/`
     - common utilities and classes used by most of the other modules
     -
   * - `discrete/`
     - general classes and modules for describing a discrete problem, taking
       care of boundary conditions, degrees of freedom, approximations,
       variables, equations, meshes, regions, quadratures, etc.

       Discretization-specific classes are in subdirectories:

       - `common/` - common parent classes for discretization-specific classes
       - `fem/` - finite element specific classes
       - `iga/` - isogeometric analysis specific classes
     -
   * - `mesh/`
     - some utilities to interface with tetgen and triangle mesh generators
     -
   * - `homogenization/`
     - the homogenization engine and supporting modules - highly
       specialized code, one of the reasons of *SfePy* existence
     - *
   * - `linalg/`
     - linear algebra functions not covered by NumPy and SciPy
     -
   * - `mechanics/`
     - modules for (continuum) mechanics: elastic constant
       conversions, tensor, units utilities, etc.
     - *
   * - `optimize/`
     - modules for shape optimization based on free-form deformation
     - *
   * - `parallel/`
     - modules supporting parallel assembling and solution of problems
     -
   * - `postprocess/`
     - Mayavi-based post-processing modules (`postproc.py`)
     -
   * - `solvers/`
     - interface classes to various internal/external solvers (linear,
       nonlinear, eigenvalue, optimization, time stepping)
     -
   * - `terms/`
     - implementation of the terms (weak formulation integrals), see
       :ref:`term_overview`
     -

The directories in the "field-specific" column are mostly interesting
for specialists working in the respective fields.

The `fem/` is the heart of the code, while the `terms/` contains the
particular integral forms usable to build equations - new term writers
should look there.

Exploring the Code
------------------

It is convenient to install IPython (see also :ref:`using-ipython`) to have the
tab completion available. Moreover, all SfePy classes can be easily examined by
printing them::

    In [1]: from sfepy.discrete.fem import Mesh

    In [2]: mesh = Mesh.from_file('meshes/2d/rectangle_tri.mesh')
    sfepy: reading mesh [line2, tri3, quad4, tetra4, hexa8] (meshes/2d/rectangle_tri.mesh)...
    sfepy: ...done in 0.00 s

    In [3]: print mesh
    Mesh:meshes/2d/rectangle_tri
      cmesh:
        CMesh: n_coor: 258, dim 2, tdim: 2, n_el 454
      descs:
        list: ['2_3']
      dim:
        2
      dims:
        list: [2]
      io:
        None
      n_el:
        454
      n_nod:
        258
      name:
        meshes/2d/rectangle_tri
      nodal_bcs:
        dict with keys: []

We recommend going through the interactive example in the tutorial
:ref:`sec-interactive-example-linear-elasticity` in this way, printing all the
variables.

Another useful tool is the :func:`debug() <sfepy.base.base.debug>` function,
that can be used as follows::

    from sfepy.base.base import debug; debug()

Try to use it in the examples with user defined functions to explore their
parameters etc. It works best with IPython installed, as then the tab
completion is available also when debugging.

.. _how_to_contribute:

How to Contribute
-----------------

Read this section if you wish to contribute some work to the *SfePy* project -
everyone is welcome to contribute. Contributions can be made in a variety of
forms, not just code. Reporting bugs and contributing to the documentation,
tutorials, and examples is in great need!

Below we describe

#. where to report problems or find existing issues and additional development
   suggestions
#. what to do to apply changes/fixes
#. what to do after you made your changes/fixes

Reporting problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Reporting a bug is the first way in which to contribute to an open source
project*

Short version: go to the main `SfePy`_ site and follow the links given there.

When you encounter a problem, try searching that site first - an answer may
already be posted in the `SfePy mailing list`_ (to which we suggest you
subscribe...), or the problem might have been added to the `SfePy issues`_.
As is true in any open source project, doing your homework by searching
for existing known problems greatly reduces the burden on the developers by
eliminating duplicate issues. If you find your problem already exists in the
issue tracker, feel free to gather more information and append it to the
issue. In case the problem is not there, create a new issue with proper labels
for the issue type and priority, and/or ask us using the mailing list.

**Note:** A google account (e.g., gmail account) is needed to join the mailing
list. A github account is needed for working with the source code repository
and issues.

**Note:** When reporting a problem, try to provide as much information as
possible concerning the version of *SfePy*, the OS / Linux distribution, and
the versions of *Python*, *NumPy* and *SciPy*, and other prerequisites. The
versions found on your system can be printed by running::

  python setup.py --help

If you are a new user, please let us know what difficulties you have with this
documentation. We greatly welcome a variety of contributions not limited to
code only.

Contributing changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Note:** To avoid duplicating work, it is highly advised that you contact the
developers on the mailing list or create an enhancement issue before starting
work on a non-trivial feature.

Before making any changes, read the :ref:`notes_patches`.

Using git and github
""""""""""""""""""""

The preferred way to contribute to *SfePy* is to fork the main repository on
github, then submit a "pull request" (PR):

#. `Create a github account`_ if you do not already have one.

#. Fork the project repository: click on the "Fork" button near the top of the
   `sfepy git repository`_ page. This creates a copy of the repository under
   your account on the github server.

#. Clone your fork to your computer::

     git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/sfepy.git

#. If you have never used git before, introduce yourself to git and make
   (optionally) some handy aliases either in ``.gitconfig`` in your home
   directory (global settings for all your git projects), or directly in
   ``.git/config`` in the repository::

     [user]
         email = mail@mail.org
         name = Name Surname

     [color]
         ui = auto
         interactive = true

     [alias]
         ci = commit
         di = diff --color-words
         st = status
         co = checkout

#. Create a feature branch to hold your changes::

     git checkout -b my-feature

   Then you can start to make your changes. Do not work in the master branch!

#. Modify some files and use git to track your local changes. The changed
   added/modified files can be listed using::

     git status

   and the changes can be reviewed using::

     git diff

   A more convenient way of achieving the above is to run::

     gitk --all

   in order to visualize of project history (all branches). There are other
   GUIs for this purpose, e.g. ``qgit``. You may need to install those tools,
   as they usually are not installed with git by default. Record a set of
   changes by::

     # schedule some of the changed files for the next commit
     git add file1 file2 ...
     # an editor will pop up where you should describe the commit
     git commit

   We recommend ``git gui`` command in case you want to add and commit only
   some changes in a modified file.

   **Note:** Do not be afraid to experiment - git works with your *local* copy
   of the repository, so it is not possible to damage the master repository. It
   is always possible to re-clone a fresh copy, in case you do something that
   is really bad.

#. The commit(s) now reflect changes, but only in your *local* git
   repository. To update your github repository with your new commit(s), run::

     git push origin my-feature:my-feature

#. Finally, when your feature is ready, and all tests pass, go to the github
   page of your sfepy repository fork, and click "Pull request" to send your
   changes to the maintainers for review. It is recommended to check that your
   contribution complies with the :ref:`notes_patches`.

In the above setup, your origin remote repository points to
``YourLogin/sfepy.git``. If you wish to fetch/merge from the main repository
instead of your forked one, you will need to add another remote to use instead
of origin. The main repository is usually called "upstream". To add it, type::

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

To synchronize your repository with the upstream, proceed as follows:

#. Fetch the upstream changes::

     git fetch upstream

   Never start with ``git pull upstream``!

#. Check the changes of the upstream master branch. You can use ``gitk --all``
   to visualize all your and remote branches. The upstream master is named
   ``remotes/upstream/master``.

#. Make sure all your local changes are either committed in a feature branch or
   stashed (see ``git stash``). Then reset your master to the upstream master::

     git checkout master
     git reset --hard upstream/master

   **Warning** The above will remove all your local commits in the master
   branch that are not in ``upstream/master``, and also reset all the changes
   in your non-committed modified files!

   Optionally, the reset command can be run conveniently in ``gitk`` by
   right-clicking on a commit you want to reset the current branch onto.

#. Optionally, rebase your feature branch onto the upstream master::

     git checkout my-feature
     git rebase upstream/master

   This is useful, for example, when the upstream master contains a change you
   need in your feature branch.

For additional information, see, for example, the `gitwash`_ git tutorial, or
its incarnation `NumPy gitwash`_.

.. _notes_patches:

Notes on commits and patches
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Follow our :ref:`coding_style`.
- Do not use lines longer than 79 characters (exception: tables of
  values, e.g., quadratures).
- Write descriptive docstrings in correct style, see :ref:`docstrings`.
- There should be one patch for one topic - do not mix unrelated things in one
  patch. For example, when you add a new function, then notice a typo in
  docstring in a nearby function and correct it, create two patches: one fixing
  the docstring, the other adding the new function.
- The commit message and description should clearly state what the patch
  does. Try to follow the style of other commit messages. Some interesting
  notes can be found at `tbaggery.com`_, namely that the commit message is
  better to be written in the present tense: "fix bug" and not "fixed bug".


Without using git
"""""""""""""""""

Without using git, send the modified files to the `SfePy mailing list`_ or
attach them using `gist`_ to the corresponding issue at the `Issues`_ web
page. Do not forget to describe the changes properly, and to follow the spirit
of :ref:`notes_patches` and the :ref:`coding_style`.

.. _coding_style:

Coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the code in SfePy should try to adhere to python style guidelines, see
`PEP-0008`_.

There are some additional recommendations:

- Prefer whole words to abbreviations in public APIs - there is completion
  after all. If some abbreviation is needed (*really* too long name), try to
  make it as comprehensible as possible. Also check the code for similar
  names - try to name things consistently with the existing code. Examples:

  - yes: ``equation``, ``transform_variables()``, ``filename``
  - rather not: ``eq``, ``transvar()``, ``fname``

- Functions have usually form ``<action>_<subject>()`` e.g.: ``save_data()``,
  ``transform_variables()``, do not use ``data_save()``,
  ``variable_transform()`` etc.
- Variables like ``V``, ``c``, ``A``, ``b``, ``x`` should be tolerated only
  locally when expressing mathematical ideas.

Really minor recommendations:

- Avoid single letter names, if you can:

  - not even for loop variables - use e.g. ir, ic, ... instead of i, j for rows
    and columns
  - not even in generators, as they "leak" (this is fixed in Python 3.x)

These are recommendations only, we will not refuse code just on the ground that
it uses slightly different formatting, as long as it follows the PEP.

Note: some old parts of the code might not follow the PEP, yet. We fix them
progressively as we update the code.

.. _docstrings:

Docstring standard
""""""""""""""""""

We use `sphinx`_ with the `numpydoc`_ extension to generate this
documentation. Refer to the sphinx site for the possible markup constructs.

Basically (with a little tweak), we try to follow the NumPy/SciPy docstring
standard as described in `NumPy documentation guide`_. See also the complete
`docstring example`_. It is exaggerated a bit to show all the
possibilities. Use your common sense here - the docstring should be sufficient
for a new user to use the documented object. A good way to remember the format
is to type::

    In [1]: import numpy as nm
    In [2]: nm.sin?

in `ipython`. The little tweak mentioned above is the starting newline::

    def function(arg1, arg2):
        """
        This is a function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg1 : array
            The coordinates of ...
        arg2 : int
            The dimension ...

        Returns
        -------
        out : array
           The resulting array of shape ....
        """

It seems visually better than::

    def function(arg1, arg2):
        """This is a function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg1 : array
            The coordinates of ...
        arg2 : int
            The dimension ...

        Returns
        -------
        out : array
           The resulting array of shape ....
        """

When using :math:`\mbox{\LaTeX}` in a docstring, use a raw string::

    def function():
        r"""
        This is a function with :math:`\mbox{\LaTeX}` math:
        :math:`\frac{1}{\pi}`.
        """

to prevent Python from interpreting and consuming the backslashes in common
escape sequences like '\\n', '\\f' etc.

.. _how_to_regenerate_documentation:

How to Regenerate Documentation
-------------------------------

The following steps summarize how to regenerate this documentation.

#. Install `sphinx`_ and `numpydoc`_. Do not forget to set the path to numpydoc
   in site_cfg.py if it is not installed in a standard location for Python
   packages on your platform. A recent :math:`\mbox{\LaTeX}` distribution is
   required, too, for example `TeX Live`_. Depending on your OS/platform, it
   can be in the form of one or several packages.

#. Edit the rst files in `doc/` directory using your favorite text editor - the
   ReST format is really simple, so nothing fancy is needed. Follow the
   existing files in `doc/`; for reference also check `reStructuredText
   Primer`_, `Sphinx Markup Constructs`_ and `docutils reStructuredText`_.

   - When adding a new Python module, add a corresponding documentation file
     into `doc/src/sfepy/<path>`, where `<path>` should reflect the location of
     the module in `sfepy/`.

   - Figures belong to `doc/images`; subdirectories can be used.

#. (Re)generate the documentation (assuming GNU make is installed)::

    cd doc
    make html

#. View it (substitute your favorite browser)::

    firefox _build/html/index.html

How to Implement a New Term
---------------------------
*tentative documentation*

**Warning** Implementing a new term usually involves C. As Cython is now
supported by our build system, it should not be that
difficult. Python-only terms are possible as well.

Notes on terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Volume* refers to the whole domain (in space of dimension :math:`d`), while
*surface* to a subdomain of dimension :math:`d-1`, for example a part of the
domain boundary. So in 3D problems volume = volume, surface = surface, while in
2D volume = area, surface = curve.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A term in *SfePy* usually corresponds to a single integral term in (weak)
integral formulation of an equation. Both volume and surface integrals are
supported. There are three types of arguments a term can have:

- *variables*, i.e. the unknown, test or parameter variables declared by the
  `variables` keyword, see :ref:`sec-problem-description-file`,
- *materials*, corresponding to material and other parameters (functions)
  that are known, declared by the `materials` keyword,
- *user data* - anything, but user is responsible for passing them to the
  evaluation functions.

SfePy terms are subclasses of :class:`sfepy.terms.terms.Term`. The purpose of a
term is to implement a (vectorized) function that evaluates the term
contribution to residual/matrix and/or evaluates the term integral in elements
of the term region. Many such functions are currently implemented in C, but
some terms are pure Python, vectorized using NumPy.

Evaluation modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A term can support several evaluation modes, as described in
:ref:`term_evaluation`.

Basic attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A term class should inherit from :class:`sfepy.terms.terms.Term` base
class. The simplest possible term with volume integration and 'weak'
evaluation mode needs to have the following attributes and methods:

- docstring (not really required per se, but we require it);
- `name` attribute - the name to be used in `equations`;
- `arg_types` attribute - the types of arguments the term accepts;
- `integration` attribute, optional - the kind of integral the term
  implements, one of `'volume'` (the default, if not given), `'surface'` or
  `'surface_extra'`;
- `function()` static method - the assembling function;
- `get_fargs()` method - the method that takes term arguments and
  converts them to arguments for `function()`.

Argument types
""""""""""""""

The argument types can be ("[_*]" denotes an optional suffix):

- `'material[_*]'` for a material parameter, i.e. any function that can
  be can evaluated in quadrature points and that is not a variable;
- `'opt_material[_*]'` for an optional material parameter, that can be left
  out - there can be only one in a term and it must be the first argument;
- `'virtual'` for a virtual (test) variable (no value defined), `'weak'`
  evaluation mode;
- `'state[_*]'` for state (unknown) variables (have value), `'weak'`
  evaluation mode;
- `'parameter[_*]'` for parameter variables (have known value), any
  evaluation mode.

Only one `'virtual'` variable is allowed in a term.

Integration kinds
"""""""""""""""""

The integration kinds have the following meaning:

- `'volume'` for volume integral over a region that contains elements;
  uses volume element connectivity for assembling;
- `'surface'` for surface integral over a region that contains faces;
  uses surface face connectivity for assembling;
- `'surface_extra'` for surface integral over a region that contains
  faces; uses volume element connectivity for assembling - this is
  needed if full gradients of a variable are required on the boundary.

`function()`
""""""""""""

The `function()` static method has always the following arguments::

    out, *args

where `out` is the already preallocated output array (change it in
place!) and `*args` are any other arguments the function requires. These
function arguments have to be provided by the `get_fargs()` method. The
function returns zero `status` on success, nonzero on failure.

The `out` array has shape `(n_el, 1, n_row, n_col)`, where `n_el` is the
number of elements and `n_row`, `n_col` are matrix dimensions
of the value on a single element.

`get_fargs()`
"""""""""""""

The `get_fargs()` method has always the same structure of arguments:

- positional arguments corresponding to `arg_types` attribute:

  - example for a typical weak term:

    - for::

        arg_types = ('material', 'virtual', 'state')

      the positional arguments are::

        material, virtual, state

- keyword arguments common to all terms::

    mode=None, term_mode=None, diff_var=None, **kwargs

  here:

  - `mode` is the actual evaluation mode, default is `'eval'`;
  - `term_mode` is an optional term sub-mode influencing what the term
    should return (example: `dw_tl_he_neohook` term has 'strain' and
    'stress' evaluation sub-modes);
  - `diff_var` is taken into account in the `'weak'` evaluation mode. It
    is either `None` (residual mode) or a name of variable with respect
    to differentiate to (matrix mode);
  - `**kwargs` are any other arguments that the term supports.

The `get_fargs()` method returns arguments for `function()`.

Additional attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These attributes are used mostly in connection with the
`tests/test_term_call_modes.py` test for automatic testing of term calls.

- `arg_shapes` attribute - the possible shapes of term arguments;
- `geometries` attribute - the list of reference element geometries that the
  term supports;
- `mode` attribute - the default evaluation mode.

Argument shapes
"""""""""""""""

The argument shapes are specified using a dict of the following form::

    arg_shapes = {'material' : 'D, D', 'virtual' : (1, 'state'),
                  'state' : 1, 'parameter_1' : 1, 'parameter_2' : 1}

The keys are the argument types listed in the `arg_types` attribute, for
example::

    arg_types = (('material', 'virtual', 'state'),
                 ('material', 'parameter_1', 'parameter_2'))

The values are the shapes containing either integers, or 'D' (for space
dimension) or 'S' (symmetric storage size corresponding to the space
dimension).  For materials, the shape is a string `'nr, nc'` or a single value,
denoting a special-valued term, or `None` denoting an optional material that is
left out. For state and parameter variables, the shape is a single value. For
virtual variables, the shape is a tuple of a single shape value and a
name of the corresponding state variable; the name can be `None`.

When several alternatives are possible, a list of dicts can be used. For
convenience, only the shapes of arguments that change w.r.t. a previous dict
need to be included, as the values of the other shapes are taken from the
previous dict. For example, the following corresponds to a case, where an
optional material has either the shape (1, 1) in each point, or is left out::

    arg_types = ('opt_material', 'parameter')
    arg_shapes = [{'opt_material' : '1, 1', 'parameter' : 1},
                  {'opt_material' : None}]

Geometries
""""""""""

The default that most terms use is a list of all the geometries::

    geometries = ['2_3', '2_4', '3_4', '3_8']

In that case, the attribute needs not to be define explicitly.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Let us now discuss the implementation of a simple weak term
`dw_volume_integrate` defined as :math:`\int_\Omega c q`, where :math:`c` is a
weight (material parameter) and :math:`q` is a virtual variable. This term is
implemented as follows::

    class IntegrateVolumeOperatorTerm(Term):
        r"""
        Volume integral of a test function weighted by a scalar function
        :math:`c`.

        :Definition:

        .. math::
            \int_\Omega q \mbox{ or } \int_\Omega c q

        :Arguments:
            - material : :math:`c` (optional)
            - virtual  : :math:`q`
        """
        name = 'dw_volume_integrate'
        arg_types = ('opt_material', 'virtual')
        arg_shapes = [{'opt_material' : '1, 1', 'virtual' : (1, None)},
                      {'opt_material' : None}]

- lines 2-14: the docstring - always write one!
- line 15: the name of the term, that can be referred to in equations;
- line 16: the argument types - here the term takes a single material
  parameter, and a virtual variable;
- lines 17-18: the possible argument shapes
- lines 20-28: the term function

  - its arguments are:

    - the output array `out`, already having the required shape,
    - the material coefficient (array) `mat` evaluated in physical
      quadrature points of elements of the term region,
    - a base function (array) `bf` evaluated in the quadrature points of
      a reference element and
    - a reference element (geometry) mapping `geo`.

  - line 22: transpose the base function and tile it so that is has
    the correct shape - it is repeated for each element;
  - line 23: ensure C contiguous order;
  - lines 24-27: perform numerical integration in C - `geo.integrate()`
    requires the C contiguous order;
  - line 28: return the status.

- lines 30-35: prepare arguments for the function above:

  - line 32: verify that the variable is scalar, as our implementation
    does not support vectors;
  - line 33: get reference element mapping corresponding to the virtual
    variable;
  - line 35: return the arguments for the function.

A more complex term that involves an unknown variable and has two call modes,
is `dw_s_dot_mgrad_s`, defined as :math:`\int_{\Omega} q \ul{y} \cdot \nabla p`
in the`'grad_state'` mode or :math:`\int_{\Omega} p \ul{y} \cdot \nabla q` in
the `'grad_virtual'` mode, where :math:`\ul{y}` is a vector material parameter,
:math:`q` is a virtual variable, and :math:`p` is a state variable::

            return out_qp, geo, fmode

Only interesting differences with respect to the previous example will by
discussed:

- the argument types and shapes (lines 23-29) have to be specified for all the
  call modes (line 30)
- the term function (lines 32-35) just integrates the element contributions, as
  all the other calculations are done by the `get_fargs()` function.
- the `get_fargs()` function (lines 37-68) contains:

  - residual computation (lines 43-54) for both modes
  - matrix computation (lines 57-66) for both modes

Concluding remarks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is just a very basic introduction to the topic of new term
implementation. Do not hesitate to ask the `SfePy mailing list`_, and look at
the source code of the already implemented terms.
