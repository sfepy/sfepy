Running Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tests are run by the ``run_tests.py`` script::

    $ ./run_tests.py -h
    Usage: run_tests.py [options] [test_filename[ test_filename ...]]

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --print-doc           print the docstring of this file (howto write new
                            tests)
      -d directory, --dir=directory
                            directory with tests [default: tests]
      -o directory, --output=directory
                            directory for storing test results and temporary files
                            [default: output-tests]
      --debug               raise silenced exceptions to see what was wrong
      --filter-none         do not filter any messages
      --filter-less         filter output (suppress all except test messages)
      --filter-more         filter output (suppress all except test result
                            messages)

Common Tasks
""""""""""""

* Run all tests, filter output; result files related to the tests can be found
  in output-tests directory::

    ./run_tests.py
    ./run_tests.py --filter-more
    ./run_tests.py --filter-less

* Run a particular test file, filter output::

    # Test if linear elasticity input file works.
    ./run_tests.py tests/test_input_le.py

* Debug a failing test::

    ./run_tests.py tests/test_input_le.py --debug

Computations and Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example problems in the ``examples`` directory can be computed by the script
``simple.py`` which is in the top-level directory of the *SfePy* distribution.
If it is run without arguments, a help message is printed::

    $ ./simple.py
    Usage: simple.py [options] filename_in

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    $ python examples/compare_elastic_materials.py

Parametric study example::

    $ ./simple.py examples/diffusion/poisson_parametric_study.py

Common Tasks
""""""""""""

* Run a simulation::

    ./simple.py examples/diffusion/poisson_short_syntax.py
    ./simple.py examples/diffusion/poisson_short_syntax.py -o some_results # -> produces some_results.vtk

* Print available terms::

    ./simple.py --list=terms

* Run a simulation and also save Dirichlet boundary conditions::

    ./simple.py --save-ebc examples/diffusion/poisson_short_syntax.py # -> produces an additional .vtk file with BC visualization

Visualization of Results
------------------------

The ``postproc.py`` script can be used for quick postprocessing and
visualization of the *SfePy* results. It requires mayavi2 installed on your
system. Running ``postproc.py`` without arguments produces::

    $ ./postproc.py
    Usage: postproc.py [options] filename

    This is a script for quick Mayavi-based visualizations of finite element
    computations results.

    Examples
    --------
      The examples assume that run_tests.py has been run successfully and the
      resulting data files are present.

      - view data in output-tests/test_navier_stokes.vtk

        $ python postproc.py output-tests/test_navier_stokes.vtk
        $ python postproc.py output-tests/test_navier_stokes.vtk --3d

      - create animation (forces offscreen rendering) from
        output-tests/test_time_poisson.*.vtk

        $ python postproc.py output-tests/test_time_poisson.*.vtk -a mov

      - create animation (forces offscreen rendering) from
        output-tests/test_hyperelastic.*.vtk

        The range specification for the displacements 'u' is required, as
        output-tests/test_hyperelastic.00.vtk contains only zero
        displacements which leads to invisible glyph size.

        $ python postproc.py output-tests/test_hyperelastic.*.vtk                          --ranges=u,0,0.02 -a mov

      - same as above, but slower frame rate

        $ python postproc.py output-tests/test_hyperelastic.*.vtk                          --ranges=u,0,0.02 -a mov --ffmpeg-options="-r 2 -sameq"

      --all                 draw all data (normally, node_groups and mat_id are

As a simple example, try::

    $ ./simple.py examples/diffusion/poisson_short_syntax.py
    $ ./postproc.py cylinder.vtk

The following window should display:

.. image:: images/postproc_simple.png

The ``-l`` switch lists information contained in a results file, e.g.::

    $ ./postproc.py -l cylinder.vtk
    sfepy: 0: cylinder.vtk
    point scalars
      "node_groups" (354,) range: 0 0 l2_norm_range: 0.0 0.0
        "t" (354,) range: -2.0 2.0 l2_norm_range: 0.0106091 2.0
        cell scalars
          "mat_id" (1348,) range: 6 6 l2_norm_range: 6.0 6.0

Problem Description File
------------------------

Here we discuss the basic items that users have to specify in their input
files. For complete examples, see the problem description files in the
``examples/`` directory of SfePy.


Long Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides the *short syntax* described below there is (due to history)
also a *long syntax* which is explained in
:doc:`problem_desc_file_long`. The short and long syntax can be mixed
together in one description file.

FE Mesh
^^^^^^^

A FE mesh defining a domain geometry can be stored in several formats:

* legacy VTK (``.vtk``)
* custom HDF5 file (``.h5``)
* medit mesh file (``.mesh``)
* tetgen mesh files (``.node``, ``.ele``)
* comsol text mesh file (``.txt``)
* abaqus text mesh file (``.inp``)
* avs-ucd text mesh file (``.inp``)
* hypermesh text mesh file (``.hmascii``)
* hermes3d mesh file (``.mesh3d``)
* nastran text mesh file (``.bdf``)
* gambit neutral text mesh file (``.neu``)
* salome/pythonocc med binary mesh file (``.med``)

**Example**::

    filename_mesh = 'meshes/3d/cylinder.vtk'

The VTK and HDF5 formats can be used for storing the results. The format
can be selected in options, see :ref:`miscellaneous_options`.

The following geometry elements are supported:

.. image:: images/elements.png

Regions
^^^^^^^

Regions serve to select a certain part of the computational domain using
topological entities of the FE mesh. They are used to define the boundary
conditions, the domains of terms and materials etc.

Let us denote D the maximal dimension of topological entities. For volume
meshes it is also the dimension of space the domain is embedded in. Then the
following topological entities can be defined on the mesh (notation follows
[Logg2012]_):

.. [Logg2012] A. Logg: Efficient Representation of Computational Meshes. 2012

.. csv-table::
   :header: topological entity, dimension, co-dimension
   :widths: 15, 15, 15

   vertex, 0, D
   edge, 1, D - 1
   face, 2, D - 2
   facet, D - 1, 1
   cell, D, 0

If D = 2, faces are not defined and facets are edges. If D = 3, facets are
faces.

Following the above definitions, a region can be of different `kind`:

- ``cell``, ``facet``, ``face``, ``edge``, ``vertex`` - entities of higher
  dimension are not included.
- ``cell_only``, ``facet_only``, ``face_only``, ``edge_only``,
  ``vertex_only`` - only the specified entities are included, other entities
  are empty sets, so that set-like operators still work, see below.
- The ``cell`` kind is the most general and should be used with volume
  terms. It is also the default if the kind is not specified in region
  definition.
- The ``facet`` kind (same as ``edge`` in 2D and ``face`` in 3D) is to be used
  with boundary (surface integral) terms.
- The ``vertex`` (same as ``vertex_only``) kind can be used with point-wise
  defined terms (e.g. point loads).

The kinds allow a clear distinction between regions of different purpose
(volume integration domains, surface domains, etc.) and could be uses to lower
memory usage.

A region definition involves `topological entity selections` combined with
`set-like operators`. The set-like operators can result in intermediate regions
that have the ``cell`` kind. The desired kind is set to the final region,
removing unneeded entities. Most entity selectors are defined in terms of
vertices and cells - the other entities are computed as needed.

Region Definition Syntax
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Regions are defined by the following Python dictionary::

        regions = {
            <name> : (<selection>, [<kind>], [<parent>]),
        }

or::

        regions = {
            <name> : <selection>,
        }

**Example definitions**::

      regions = {
          'Omega' : 'all',
          'Right' : ('vertices in (x > 0.99)', 'facet'),
          'Gamma1' : ("""(cells of group 1 *v cells of group 2)
                         +v r.Right""", 'facet', 'Omega'),
      }

.. _User's Guide-Fields:

Fields
^^^^^^

Fields correspond to FE spaces::

          fields = {
              <name> : (<data_type>, <shape>, <region_name>, <approx_order>)
          }

where
  * <data_type> is a numpy type (float64 or complex128) or
    'real' or 'complex'
  * <shape> is the number of DOFs per node: 1 or (1,) or 'scalar', space
    dimension (2, or (2,) or 3 or (3,)) or 'vector'; it can be other
      positive integer than just 1, 2, or 3
  * <region_name> is the name of region where the field is defined
  * <approx_order> is the FE approximation order, e.g. 0, 1, 2, '1B' (1
    with bubble)

**Example**: scalar P1 elements in 2D on a region Omega::

        fields = {
            'temperature' : ('real', 1, 'Omega', 1),
        }

The following approximation orders can be used:

  * simplex elements: 1, 2, '1B', '2B'
  * tensor product elements: 0, 1, '1B'

  Optional bubble function enrichment is marked by 'B'.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

Variables use the FE approximation given by the specified field::

        variables = {
            <name> : (<kind>, <field_name>, <spec>, [<history>])
        }

where
  * <kind> - 'unknown field', 'test field' or 'parameter field'
  * <spec> - in case of: primary variable - order in the global vector
    of unknowns, dual variable - name of primary variable
  * <history> - number of time steps to remember prior to current step

**Example**::

        variables = {
            't' : ('unknown field', 'temperature', 0, 1),
            's' : ('test field', 'temperature', 't'),
        }

.. _ug_integrals:

Integrals
^^^^^^^^^

Define the integral type and quadrature rule. This keyword is
optional, as the integration orders can be specified directly in
equations (see below)::

        integrals = {
            <name> : <order>
        }

where
  * <name> - the integral name - it has to begin with 'i'!
  * <order> - the order of polynomials to integrate, or 'custom' for
    integrals with explicitly given values and weights

**Example**::

Essential Boundary Conditions and Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The essential boundary conditions set values of DOFs in some regions, while the
constraints constrain or transform values of DOFs in some regions.

Dirichlet Boundary Conditions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Dirichlet, or essential, boundary conditions apply in a given region given
by its name, and, optionally, in selected times. The times can be given either
using a list of tuples `(t0, t1)` making the condition active for `t0 <= t <
t1`, or by a name of a function taking the time argument and returning True or
False depending on whether the condition is active at the given time or not.

Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions::

    ebcs = {
        <name> : (<region_name>, [<times_specification>,]
                  {<dof_specification> : <value>[,
                   <dof_specification> : <value>, ...]})
    }

**Example**::

        ebcs = {
            'u1' : ('Left', {'u.all' : 0.0}),
            'u2' : ('Right', [(0.0, 1.0)], {'u.0' : 0.1}),
            'phi' : ('Surface', {'phi.all' : 0.0}),
        }

Periodic Boundary Conditions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The periodic boundary conditions tie DOFs of a single variable in two regions
that have matching nodes. Can be used with functions in
:mod:`sfepy.discrete.fem.periodic`.

Periodic boundary conditions::

    epbcs = {
        <name> : ((<region1_name>, <region2_name>), [<times_specification>,]
                  {<dof_specification> : <dof_specification>[,
                   <dof_specification> : <dof_specification>, ...]},
                  <match_function_name>)
    }

**Example**::

        epbcs = {
            'up1' : (('Left', 'Right'), {'u.all' : 'u.all', 'p.0' : 'p.0'},
                     'match_y_line'),
        }

Linear Combination Boundary Conditions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The linear combination boundary conditions (LCBCs) are more general than the
Dirichlet BCs or periodic BCs. They can be used to substitute one set of DOFs
in a region by another set of DOFs, possibly in another region and of another
variable. The LCBCs can be used only in FEM with nodal (Lagrange) basis.

Available LCBC kinds:

- ``'rigid'`` - in linear elasticity problems, a region moves as a rigid body;
- ``'no_penetration'`` - in flow problems, the velocity vector is constrained
  to the plane tangent to the surface;
- ``'normal_direction'`` - the velocity vector is constrained to the normal
  direction;
- ``'edge_direction'`` - the velocity vector is constrained to the mesh edge
  direction;
- ``'integral_mean_value'`` - all DOFs in a region are summed to a single new
  DOF;
- ``'shifted_periodic'`` - generalized periodic BCs that work with two
  different variables and can have a non-zero mutual shift.

Only the ``'shifted_periodic'`` LCBC needs the second region and the DOF
mapping function, see below.

Linear combination boundary conditions::

        lcbcs = {
            'shifted' : (('Left', 'Right'),
                         {'u1.all' : 'u2.all'},
                         'match_y_line', 'shifted_periodic',
                         'get_shift'),
            'mean' : ('Middle', {'u1.all' : None}, None, 'integral_mean_value'),
        }

Initial Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initial conditions are applied prior to the boundary conditions - no special
care must be used for the boundary dofs::

    ics = {
        <name> : (<region_name>, {<dof_specification> : <value>[,
                                  <dof_specification> : <value>, ...]},...)
    }

**Example**::

        ics = {
            'ic' : ('Omega', {'T.0' : 5.0}),
        }

Materials
^^^^^^^^^

Materials are used to define constitutive parameters (e.g. stiffness,
permeability, or viscosity), and other non-field arguments of terms (e.g. known
traction or volume forces). Depending on a particular term, the parameters can
be constants, functions defined over FE mesh nodes, functions defined in the
elements, etc.

**Example**::

    material = {
        'm' : ({'val' : [0.0, -1.0, 0.0]},),
        'm2' : 'get_pars',
        'm3' : (None, 'get_pars'), # Same as the above line.
    }

**Example**: different material parameters in regions 'Yc', 'Ym'::

    from sfepy.mechanics.matcoefs import stiffness_from_youngpoisson
    dim = 3
    materials = {
        'mat' : ({'D' : {
            'Ym': stiffness_from_youngpoisson(dim, 7.0e9, 0.4),
            'Yc': stiffness_from_youngpoisson(dim, 70.0e9, 0.2)}
        },),
    }


Equations and Terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Equations can be built by combining terms listed in :ref:`term_table`.

Examples
""""""""

* Laplace equation, named integral::

    equations = {
        'Temperature' : """dw_laplace.i.Omega( coef.val, s, t ) = 0"""
    }

* Laplace equation, simplified integral given by order::

    equations = {
        'Temperature' : """dw_laplace.2.Omega( coef.val, s, t ) = 0"""
    }

* Laplace equation, automatic integration order (not implemented yet!)::

    equations = {
        'Temperature' : """dw_laplace.a.Omega( coef.val, s, t ) = 0"""
    }

* Navier-Stokes equations::

    equations = {

        """+ dw_div_grad.i2.Omega( fluid.viscosity, v, u )
           + dw_convect.i2.Omega( v, u )

        'incompressibility' :
        """dw_stokes.i1.Omega( u, q ) = 0""",
    }

Configuring Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In SfePy, a non-linear solver has to be specified even when solving a linear
problem. The linear problem is/should be then solved in one iteration of the
nonlinear solver.

Linear and nonlinear solver::

    solvers = {
        'ls' : ('ls.scipy_direct', {}),
        'newton' : ('nls.newton',
                    {'i_max'   : 1,
                     'problem' : 'nonlinear'}),
    }

Solver selection::

    options = {
        'nls' : 'newton',
        'ls' : 'ls',
    }

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

Functions are a way of customizing *SfePy* behavior. They make it possible to
define material properties, boundary conditions, parametric sweeps, and other
items in an arbitrary manner. Functions are normal Python functions declared in
the Problem Definition file, so they can invoke the full power of Python. In
order for *SfePy* to make use of the functions, they must be declared using the
function keyword. See the examples below.

Defining Material Parameters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The functions for defining material parameters can work in two modes,
distinguished by the `mode` argument. The two modes are 'qp' and 'special'. The
first mode is used for usual functions that define parameters in quadrature
points (hence 'qp'), while the second one can be used for special values like
various flags.

The shape and type of data returned in the 'special' mode can be arbitrary
(depending on the term used). On the other hand, in the 'qp' mode all the data
have to be numpy float64 arrays with shape `(n_coor, n_row, n_col)`, where
`n_coor` is the number of quadrature points given by the `coors` argument,
`n_coor = coors.shape[0]`, and `(n_row, n_col)` is the shape of a material
parameter in each quadrature point. For example, for scalar parameters, the
shape is `(n_coor, 1, 1)`.

Examples
""""""""

See ``examples/diffusion/poisson_functions.py`` for a complete problem
description file demonstrating how to use different kinds of functions.

- functions for defining regions::

    def get_circle(coors, domain=None):
        r = nm.sqrt(coors[:,0]**2.0 + coors[:,1]**2.0)
        return nm.where(r < 0.2)[0]

    functions = {
        'get_circle' : (get_circle,),
    }

- functions for defining boundary conditions::

    def get_p_edge(ts, coors, bc=None, problem=None):
        if bc.name == 'p_left':
            return nm.sin(nm.pi * coors[:,1])
        else:
            return nm.cos(nm.pi * coors[:,1])

    functions = {
        'get_p_edge' : (get_p_edge,),
    }

    ebcs = {
        'p' : ('Gamma', {'p.0' : 'get_p_edge'}),
    }

  The values can be given by a function of time, coordinates and
  possibly other data, for example::

    ebcs = {
        'f1' : ('Gamma1', {'u.0' : 'get_ebc_x'}),
        'f2' : ('Gamma2', {'u.all' : 'get_ebc_all'}),
    }

    def get_ebc_x(coors, amplitude):
        z = coors[:, 2]
        val = amplitude * nm.sin(z * 2.0 * nm.pi)
        return val

    def get_ebc_all(ts, coors):
        x, y, z = coors[:, 0], coors[:, 1], coors[:, 2]
        val = ts.step * nm.r_[x, y, z]
        return val

    functions = {
        'get_ebc_x' : (lambda ts, coors, bc, problem, **kwargs:
                       get_ebc_x(coors, 5.0),),
        'get_ebc_all' : (lambda ts, coors, bc, problem, **kwargs:
                         get_ebc_all(ts, coors),),
    }

  Note that when setting more than one component as in `get_ebc_all()`
  above, the function should return a single one-dimensional vector with
  all values of the first component, then of the second one
  etc. concatenated together.

- function for defining usual material parameters::

    def get_pars(ts, coors, mode=None, **kwargs):
        if mode == 'qp':
            val = coors[:,0]
            val.shape = (coors.shape[0], 1, 1)

            return {'x_coor' : val}

    functions = {
        'get_pars' : (get_pars,),
    }

  The keyword arguments contain both additional use-specified arguments, if
  any, and the following: ``equations, term, problem``, for cases when the
  function needs access to the equations, problem, or term instances that
  requested the parameters that are being evaluated. The full signature of the
  function is::

    def get_pars(ts, coors, mode=None,
                 equations=None, term=None, problem=None, **kwargs)

- function for defining special material parameters, with an extra argument::

    def get_pars_special(ts, coors, mode=None, extra_arg=None):
        if mode == 'special':
            if extra_arg == 'hello!':
                ic = 0
            else:
                ic = 1
            return {('x_%s' % ic) : coors[:,ic]}

    functions = {
        'get_pars1' : (lambda ts, coors, mode=None, **kwargs:
                       get_pars_special(ts, coors, mode,
                                        extra_arg='hello!'),),
    }

    # Just another way of adding a function, besides 'functions' keyword.
    function_1 = {
        'name' : 'get_pars2',
        'function' : lambda ts, coors, mode=None, **kwargs:
            get_pars_special(ts, coors, mode, extra_arg='hi!'),
    }

- function combining both kinds of material parameters::

    def get_pars_both(ts, coors, mode=None, **kwargs):
        out = {}

        if mode == 'special':

            out['flag'] = coors.max() > 1.0

        elif mode == 'qp':

            val = coors[:,1]
            val.shape = (coors.shape[0], 1, 1)

            out['y_coor'] = val

        return out

    functions = {
        'get_pars_both' : (get_pars_both,),
    }

- function for setting values of a parameter variable::

    variable_1 = {
        'name' : 'p',
        'kind' : 'parameter field',
        'field' : 'temperature',
        'like' : None,
        'special' : {'setter' : 'get_load_variable'},
    }

    def get_load_variable(ts, coors, region=None):
        y = coors[:,1]
        val = 5e5 * y
        return val

    functions = {
        'get_load_variable' : (get_load_variable,)
    }

.. _miscellaneous_options:

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The options can be used to select solvers, output file format, output
directory, to register functions to be called at various phases of the
solution (the `hooks`), and for other settings.

Additional options (including solver selection)::

    options = {
        # string, output directory
        'output_dir'        : 'output/<output_dir>',

        # 'vtk' or 'h5', output file (results) format
        'output_format'     : 'h5',

        # string, nonlinear solver name
        'nls' : 'newton',

        # string, linear solver name
        'ls' : 'ls',

        # string, time stepping solver name
        'ts' : 'ts',

        # int, number of time steps when results should be saved (spaced
        # regularly from 0 to n_step), or -1 for all time steps
        'save_steps' : -1,

        # string, a function to be called after each time step
        'step_hook'  : '<step_hook_function>',

        # string, a function to be called after each time step, used to
        # update the results to be saved
        'post_process_hook' : '<post_process_hook_function>',

        # string, as above, at the end of simulation
        'post_process_hook_final' : '<post_process_hook_final_function>',

        # string, a function to generate probe instances
        'gen_probes'        : '<gen_probes_function>',

        # string, a function to probe data
        'probe_hook'        : '<probe_hook_function>',

        # string, a function to modify problem definition parameters
        'parametric_hook' : '<parametric_hook_function>',
    }

* ``post_process_hook`` enables computing derived quantities, like
  stress or strain, from the primary unknown variables. See the
  examples in ``examples/large_deformation/`` directory.
* ``parametric_hook`` makes it possible to run parametric studies by
  modifying the problem description programmatically. See
  ``examples/diffusion/poisson_parametric_study.py`` for an example.
* ``output_dir`` redirects output files to specified directory


Building Equations in SfePy
---------------------------

Equations in *SfePy* are built using terms, which correspond directly to the
integral forms of weak formulation of a problem to be solved. As an example, let
us consider the Laplace equation in time interval :math:`t \in [0, t_{\rm
final}]`:

.. math::
   :label: eq_laplace

    \pdiff{T}{t} + c \Delta T = 0 \mbox{ in }\Omega,\quad T(t) = \bar{T}(t)
    \mbox{ on } \Gamma \;.

The weak formulation of :eq:`eq_laplace` is: Find :math:`T \in V`, such that

.. math::
   :label: eq_wlaplace

    \int_{\Omega} s \pdiff{T}{t} + \int_{\Omega} c\ \nabla T : \nabla s = 0,
    \quad \forall s \in V_0 \;,

where we assume no fluxes over :math:`\partial \Omega \setminus \Gamma`. In the
syntax used in *SfePy* input files, this can be written as::

    dw_volume_dot.i.Omega( s, dT/dt ) + dw_laplace.i.Omega( coef, s, T) = 0

which directly corresponds to the discrete version of :eq:`eq_wlaplace`: Find
:math:`\bm{T} \in V_h`, such that

.. math::

    \bm{s}^T (\int_{\Omega_h} \bm{\phi}^T \bm{\phi}) \pdiff{\bm{T}}{t} +
    \bm{s}^T (\int_{\Omega_h} c\ \bm{G}^T \bm{G}) \bm{T} = 0, \quad \forall
    \bm{s} \in V_{h0} \;,

where :math:`u \approx \bm{\phi} \bm{u}`, :math:`\nabla u \approx \bm{G}
\bm{u}` for :math:`u \in \{s, T\}`. The integrals over the discrete domain
:math:`\Omega_h` are approximated by a numerical quadrature, that is named
:math:`\verb|i|` in our case.

Syntax of Terms in Equations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The terms in equations are written in form::

    <term_name>.<i>.<r>( <arg1>, <arg2>, ... )

where ``<i>`` denotes an integral name (i.e. a name of numerical quadrature to
use) and ``<r>`` marks a region (domain of the integral). In the following,
``<virtual>`` corresponds to a test function, ``<state>`` to a unknown function
and ``<parameter>`` to a known function arguments.

When solving, the individual terms in equations are evaluated in the `'weak'`
mode. The evaluation modes are described in the next section.

.. _term_evaluation:

Term Evaluation
---------------

Terms can be evaluated in two ways:

#. implicitly by using them in equations;
#. explicitly using :func:`Problem.evaluate()
   <sfepy.discrete.problem.Problem.evaluate>`. This way is mostly used
   in the postprocessing.

Each term supports one or more *evaluation modes*:

- `'weak'` : Assemble (in the finite element sense) either the vector or matrix
  depending on `diff_var` argument (the name of variable to differentiate with
  respect to) of :func:`Term.evaluate() <sfepy.terms.terms.Term.evaluate>`.
  This mode is usually used implicitly when building the linear system
  corresponding to given equations.

- `'eval'` : The evaluation mode integrates the term (= integral) over a
  region. The result has the same dimension as the quantity being
  integrated. This mode can be used, for example, to compute some global
  quantities during postprocessing such as fluxes or total values of extensive
  quantities (mass, volume, energy, ...).

- `'el_avg'` : The element average mode results in an array of a quantity
  averaged in each element of a region. This is the mode for postprocessing.

- `'el'` : The element integral value mode results in an array of a quantity
  integrated over each element of a region. This mode is supported only by
  some special terms.

- `'qp'` : The quadrature points mode results in an array of a quantity
  interpolated into quadrature points of each element in a region. This mode is
  used when further point-wise calculations with the result are needed. The
  same element type and number of quadrature points in each element are
  assumed.

Not all terms support all the modes - consult the documentation of the
individual terms. There are, however, certain naming conventions:

- `'dw_*'` terms support `'weak'` mode
- `'dq_*'` terms support `'qp'` mode
- `'d_*'`, `'di_*'` terms support `'eval'` mode
- `'ev_*'` terms support `'eval'`, `'el_avg'` and `'qp'` modes

Note that the naming prefixes are due to history when the `mode` argument to
:func:`Problem.evaluate()
<sfepy.discrete.problem.Problem.evaluate>` and :func:`Term.evaluate()
<sfepy.terms.terms.Term.evaluate>` was not available. Now they are often
redundant, but are kept around to indicate the evaluation purpose of each term.

Several examples of using the :func:`Problem.evaluate()
<sfepy.discrete.problem.Problem.evaluate>` function are shown below.

Solution Postprocessing
-----------------------

A solution to equations given in a problem description file is given by the
variables of the 'unknown field' kind, that are set in the solution procedure.
By default, those are the only values that are stored into a results file. The
solution postprocessing allows computing additional, derived, quantities, based
on the primary variables values, as well as any other quantities to be stored
in the results.

Let us illustrate this using several typical examples. Let us assume that the
postprocessing function is called `'post_process()'`, and is added to options
as discussed in :ref:`miscellaneous_options`, see `'post_process_hook'` and
`'post_process_hook_final'`. Then:

- compute stress and strain given the displacements (variable `u`)::

    def post_process(out, problem, state, extend=False):
        """
        This will be called after the problem is solved.

        Parameters
        ----------
        out : dict
            The output dictionary, where this function will store additional
            data.
        problem : Problem instance
            The current Problem instance.
        state : State instance
            The computed state, containing FE coefficients of all the unknown
            variables.
        extend : bool
            The flag indicating whether to extend the output data to the whole
            domain. It can be ignored if the problem is solved on the whole
            domain already.

        Returns
        -------
        out : dict
            The updated output dictionary.
        """

        return out

  The full example is :ref:`biot-biot_npbc`.

- store values of a non-homogeneous material parameter::

    def post_process(out, pb, state, extend=False):
        from sfepy.base.base import Struct

        mu = pb.evaluate('ev_integrate_mat.2.Omega(nonlinear.mu, u)',
                         mode='el_avg', copy_materials=False, verbose=False)
        out['mu'] = Struct(name='mu', mode='cell', data=mu, dofs=None)

        return out

  The full example is :ref:`linear_elasticity-material_nonlinearity`.

- compute volume of a region (`u` is any variable defined in the region
  `Omega`)::

    volume = problem.evaluate('d_volume.2.Omega(u)')

Probing
-------

Probing applies interpolation to output the solution along specified
paths. There are two ways of probing:

- *VTK* probes: It is the simple way of probing using the
  `'post_process_hook'`. It generates matplotlib figures with the
  probing results and previews of the mesh with the probe paths.  See
  :doc:`primer` or :ref:`linear_elasticity-its2D_5` example.

- *SfePy* probes: As mentioned in :ref:`miscellaneous_options`, it
  relies on defining two additional functions, namely the
  `'gen_probes'` function, that should create the required probes (see
  :mod:`sfepy.discrete.probes`), and the `'probe_hook'` function that
  performs the actual probing of the results for each of the
  probes. This function can return the probing results, as well as a
  handle to a corresponding matplotlib figure. See
  :ref:`linear_elasticity-its2D_4` for additional explanation.

Available Solvers
-----------------

This Section describes solvers available in SfePy from user's
perspective. There internal/external solvers include linear, nonlinear,
eigenvalue, optimization and time stepping solvers.

Nonlinear Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Almost every problem, even linear, is solved in SfePy using a nonlinear
solver that calls a linear solver in each iteration. This approach
unifies treatment of linear and non-linear problems, and simplifies
application of Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions, as the linear
system computes not a solution, but a solution increment, i.e., it
always has zero boundary conditions.

The following solvers are available:

- 'nls.newton': Newton solver with backtracking line-search - this is
  the default solver, that is used for almost all examples.
- 'nls.oseen': Oseen problem solver tailored for stabilized
  Navier-Stokes equations (see :ref:`navier_stokes-stabilized_navier_stokes`).
- 'nls.scipy_broyden_like': interface to Broyden and Anderson solvers
  from scipy.optimize.
- 'nls.semismooth_newton': Semismooth Newton method for contact/friction
  problems.

Linear Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good linear solver is key to solving efficiently stationary as well as
transient PDEs with implicit time-stepping. The following solvers are
available:

- 'ls.scipy_direct': direct solver from SciPy - this is the default
  solver for all examples. It is strongly recommended to install umfpack
  and its SciPy wrappers to get good performance.
- 'ls.umfpack': alias to 'ls.scipy_direct'.
- 'ls.scipy_iterative': Interface to SciPy iterative solvers.
- 'ls.pyamg': Interface to PyAMG solvers.
- 'ls.petsc': Interface to Krylov subspace solvers of PETSc.
- 'ls.petsc_parallel': Interface to Krylov subspace solvers of PETSc
  able to run in parallel by storing the system to disk and running a
  separate script via `mpiexec`.
- 'ls.schur_complement': Schur complement problem solver.

Isogeometric Analysis
---------------------

`Isogeometric analysis`_ (IGA) is a recently developed computational approach
that allows using the NURBS-based domain description from CAD design tools also
for approximation purposes similar to the finite element method.

The implementation is SfePy is based on Bezier extraction of NURBS as developed
in [1]_. This approach allows reusing the existing finite element assembling
routines, as still the evaluation of weak forms occurs locally in "elements"
and the local contributions are then assembled to the global system.

Current Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IGA code is still very preliminary and some crucial components are missing.
The current implementation is also very slow, as it is in pure Python.

The following already works:

- single patch tensor product domain support in 2D and 3D
- region selection based on topological Bezier mesh, see below
- Dirichlet boundary conditions constant on entire sides of a patch
- both scalar and vector volume terms work
- term integration over the whole domain as well as a volume subdomain
- simple linearization (output file generation) based on sampling the results
  with uniform parametric vectors
- basic domain generation with ``script/gen_iga_patch.py`` based on `igakit`_

The following is not implemented yet:

- tests
- theoretical convergence rate verification
- fast basis evaluation
- surface terms
- general Dirichlet boundary conditions (non-constant and/or on a subset of a
  side)
- other boundary conditions
- evaluation in arbitrary point in the physical domain
- proper (adaptive) linearization for post-processing
- support for multiple NURBS patches

Domain Description
""""""""""""""""""

The domain description is in custom HDF5-based files with ``.iga`` extension.
Such a file contains:

- NURBS patch data (knots, degrees, control points and weights). Those can
  either be generated using ``igakit``, created manually or imported from other
  tools.
- Bezier extraction operators and corresponding DOF connectivity (computed by
  SfePy).
- Bezier mesh control points, weights and connectivity (computed by SfePy).

The Bezier mesh is used to create a topological Bezier mesh - a subset of the
Bezier mesh containing the Bezier element corner vertices only. Those vertices
are interpolatory (are on the exact geometry) and so can be used for region
selections.

Region Selection
""""""""""""""""

The domain description files contain vertex sets for regions corresponding to
the patch sides, named ``'xiIJ'``, where ``I`` is the parametric axis (0, 1,
or 2) and ``J`` is 0 or 1 for the beginning and end of the axis knot span.
Other regions can be defined in the usual way, using the topological Bezier
mesh entities.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The examples demonstrating the use of IGA in SfePy are:

- :ref:`diffusion-poisson_iga`
- :ref:`linear_elasticity-linear_elastic_iga`

Their problem description files are almost the same as their FEM equivalents,
with the following differences:

- There is ``filename_domain`` instead of ``filename_mesh``.
- Fields are defined as follows::

    fields = {
        'temperature' : ('real', 1, 'Omega', None, 'H1', 'iga'),
    }

  The approximation order is ``None`` as it is given by the NURBS degrees in
  the domain description.
