General Information
===================

We are interested in any contribution. There are many ways how you can
contribute:

- You can report bugs using `our mailing list`_. You can also add a bug
  report (or a comment) into the `issues`_.
- You can contribute interesting examples/tutorials.
- You can blog about how you use SfePy (let us know!).
- You can help with improving our documentation and these pages.
- ...

To get acquainted with SfePy, you can start by reading the :ref:`sec-tutorial`
and :ref:`sec-primer` sections of the documentation and trying out the examples
that come with the sources. Your first contribution could be pinpointing
anything that is not clear in the docs.

We also recommend reading the :ref:`how_to_contribute` section of our
:ref:`developer_guide`.
